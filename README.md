# Titanic-Kaggle

This project is a work in progress. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict an individual's survival after the sinking of the Titanic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_Titanic). These predictions will then be submited to the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competion on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

Stages:
1. Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Modeling
4. Validation/Testing
5. Feature Engineering
6. Prediction
